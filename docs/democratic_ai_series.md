**Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing an important part in our sociopolitical life.**

Some worry about the erosion of democracy as AI propagates disinformation and entraps citizens in epistemic bubbles; others are convinced of AIâ€™s ability to facilitate direct democracy and make public deliberation more efficient. 

In the Democratic AI series, Simon and Yung-Hsuan guide the audience to explore how various AI tools can foster healthy democratic deliberation and collective decision-making.
